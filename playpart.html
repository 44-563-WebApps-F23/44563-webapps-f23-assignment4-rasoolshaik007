        <h1>Khaja Nayab Rasool Shaik acts in a play</h1>
        <h4>The Master Builder Act 3 by Ibsen</h4>
        <p>
            <p>The large broad verandah of SOLNESS'S dwelling-house.  Part
            of the house, with outer door leading to the verandah, is
            seen to the left.  A railing along the verandah to the right.
            At the back, from the end of the verandah, a flight of steps
            leads down to the garden below.  Tall old trees in the
            garden spread their branches over the verandah and towards
            the house.  Far to the right, in among the trees, a glimpse
            is caught of the lower part of the new villa, with scaffolding
            round so much as is seen of the tower.  In the background
            the garden is bounded by an old wooden fence.  Outside the
            fence, a street with low, tumble-down cottages.</p>
    
            <p>Evening sky with sun-lit clouds.</p>
    
            <p>On the verandah, a garden bench stands along the wall of the
            house, and in front of the bench a long table.  On the other
            side of the table, an arm-chair and some stools.  All the
            furniture is of wicker-work.</p>
    
            <p>MRS. SOLNESS, wrapped in a large white crepe shawl, sits
            resting in the arm-chair and gazes over to the right.
            Shortly after, HILDA WANGEL comes up the flight of steps
            from the garden.  She is dressed as in the last act, and
            wears her hat.  She has in her bodice a little nosegay of
            small common flowers.</p>
          
          <h6>MRS. SOLNESS.</h6>
          
          <p>[Turning her head a little.]</p> <p>Have you been round the garden, Miss
          Wangel?</p>

          <h6>HILDA.</h6>
          <p>Yes, I have been taking a look at it.</p>
          
          <h6>MRS. SOLNESS.</h6>
          <p>And found some flowers too, I see.</p>
          
          <h6>HILDA.</h6>
          <p>Yes, indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.</p>
          
          <h6>MRS. SOLNESS.</h6>
          <p>Are there, really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.</p>
    
          <h6>HILDA.</h6>
          <p>[Closer.]</p> <p>What! Don't you take a run down into the garden every day,
          then?</p>
        
          <h6>MRS. SOLNESS.</h6>
          <p>[With a faint smile.]</p> <p>I don't "run" anywhere, nowadays.</p>
          
          <h6>HILDA.</h6>
          <p>Well, but do you not go down now and then to look at all the lovely
          things there?</p>
          
          <h6>MRS. SOLNESS.</h6>
          <p>It has all become so strange to me. I am almost afraid to see it again.</p>
          
          <h6>HILDA.</h6>
          <p>Your own garden!</p>
